# Simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game using **HTML** and **JavaScript**. The game can be played in a browser and allows two players to compete by taking turns placing X's and O's on a 3x3 grid.

## Overview

This project was designed for a **web development** class. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, and it checks for win conditions or a tie after every move.

### Key Files

- **index.html**: Defines the 3x3 game grid and includes buttons for player interaction.
- **script.js**: Implements the core game logic, including turn switching, win/tie detection, and resetting the game.
### How to Play
Run the _index.html_ file to load the page.
Start the Game: Once the page is loaded, Player 1 (O) starts the game by clicking on an empty square in the 3x3 grid.
Alternate Turns: Players take turns clicking on empty squares to place their marks (O for Player 1, X for Player 2).
Win or Tie: The game checks after every move to see if there is a winner (three in a row, column, or diagonal). If all squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.
Reset: After the game ends, reload the page to clear the grid and start a new round.
